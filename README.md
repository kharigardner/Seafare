# Seafare

## *A innovative blockchain and smart contract framework built with Security, Ethics, and Accuracy in mind.*

<div>&nbsp;</div>

## **Introduction**
 Seafare is an innovative blockchain and smart contract framework built with the SEA (Security, Ethics, Accuracy) principles in mind. Seafare is written in Rust, and is currently in development. Our goal is to create a blockchain that is secure, ethical, and creates a backbone of intelligent data driven applications.

## **Features**
- :shield: Secure, with a focus on privacy and personal security, similar to Monero
- :dart: Accurate, with a focus on ensuring data integrity and quality 
- :heart: Ethical, with a focus on ensuring that the blockchain is used for good, and utilizes the least amount of resources possible, combining a proof of work and proof of stake system
- :rocket: Super fast and lightweight, using the power of Rust
- :eyes: Anoymized ledger, accessible only through people already in the network
- :lock: Encrypted transactions, utilizing decentralized encryption and data storage
- :moneybag: Tokens can be created and used for a variety of purposes, including voting, and other applications
- :computer: Support for multiple languages, including Rust, Python, and more
